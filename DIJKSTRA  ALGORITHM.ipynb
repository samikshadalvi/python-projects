    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**:\n",
    "   - `from heapq import *`: This imports everything from the `heapq` module, which provides heap queue algorithm (priority queue) implementations.\n",
    "   - `from collections import defaultdict`: This imports the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. `defaultdict` is like a regular dictionary, but it has a default value for keys that haven't been set yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Definition (`dijkstra`)**:\n",
    "   - This function is named `dijkstra`, after the algorithm it implements, Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
    "   - It takes three arguments: `edges`, which is a list of tuples representing the edges of the graph, `start_node`, the starting node for the shortest path search, and `end_node`, the destination node for the shortest path search.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initializing the Graph (`g`)**:\n",
    "   - A defaultdict named `g` is created to store the graph. This defaultdict will map each node to a list of its neighbors along with the corresponding edge weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Building the Graph**:\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates through the `edges` list. For each edge, it adds an entry to the graph `g`, where the key is the start node, and the value is a list containing a tuple with the weight of the edge and the end node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Initializing the Priority Queue (`q`) and Visited Set (`visited`)**:\n",
    "   - `q` is a list of tuples representing the priority queue. Each tuple contains the cost of reaching a node, the node itself, and the path taken so far.\n",
    "   - `visited` is a set that keeps track of the nodes that have been visited during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Main Loop**:\n",
    "   - The `while` loop continues until the priority queue `q` is empty.\n",
    "   - In each iteration, it pops the node with the lowest cost from the priority queue.\n",
    "   - If the popped node hasn't been visited yet, it marks it as visited and updates the current path.\n",
    "   - If the popped node is the destination node, it returns the cost and the path.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, it explores the neighbors of the current node, calculates the cost to reach each neighbor, and adds them to the priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Printing the Priority Queue (`q`)**:\n",
    "   - During each iteration of the main loop, the contents of the priority queue `q` are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Returning Infinity if No Path Found**:\n",
    "   - If the destination node is not reachable from the start node, the function returns infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Main Block**:\n",
    "   - In the main block, a list of edges representing a graph is defined.\n",
    "   - The `dijkstra` function is called with the defined edges and the start and end nodes set to find the shortest path from node \"A\" to node \"G\".\n",
    "   - The result, which contains the cost and the path, is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It's a powerful algorithm commonly used in routing and network optimization problems."
